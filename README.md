This is a challenge that tests my ability to use API calling. The first activity pulls weather data from a pool of determined cities. Utilizing that data we are able to draw conclusions and look for correlations within the data,
The second activity first narrows down the previous dataset to find ideal vaction spots based off of weather. I then used another API call to search for hotels within a radius of those cities.
